## Description

_"A game set in a breathtaking plot that mixes intelligence, reflection and racket sports. Many times praised by critics, this game will appeal both small and fat people."_

... AKA a shameless parody of Flappy Bird starring [Baborlelefan](https://twitter.com/baborlelefan)

The game was realized just for fun in a few nights with SpriteKit. The assets were provided by my talented friend [Max](https://twitter.com/SoGreeen). It got quite successful among Babor's fan on twitter and is still ranked 5 stars on the App Store with ~150 ratings and ~40 reviews (most likely more thanks to Babor's followers sense of humor than to the quality of the app itself, let's be honest).

## Known bugs

Some players experienced random crashes, I unfortunately never had time to fix it.
